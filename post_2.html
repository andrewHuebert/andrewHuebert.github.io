          <p>At the end of January, I had the opportunity to visit New Orleans for the CheckPoint CPX 360 annual conference. This conference
		  is a chance for CheckPoint to discuss the new and upcoming events and products that they will be releasing this calendar year.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>This conference, which was my first work trip, was an incredible experience. I got to visit the amazing city and see the history
		  and the life of the city at night. During the day were in the main convention center learning about the up an coming advances in the
		  Information Security world.
		  </p>

		  <p>CheckPoint discussed the new support system that they are rolling out, focusing on the clients and the customers, while expanding
		  their sales and support teams. With this new setup, CheckPoint is hoping to be able to not only appease their current customers, but
		  also gain new ones with their better support and more competitive pricing.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>A big part of the conference was the 'Expo' where vendors were able to display and showcase their features and applications that can
		  work with, and improve a CheckPoint firewall. There were vendors from every walk of technology, from hardware to software, there to show
		  what their company can offer.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>All in all this conference was an amazing experience where I was able to learn about the new CheckPoint programs as well as the
		  technology and services that go along with it. This was undeniably an amazing first business trip.
		  </p>
