			<p>The other day I recieved a call from a family member complaining that they didn't get great Wi-Fi while they were in their bedroom. They had a standard 250 mb/s speed
			but couldn't seem to get steady connection. They asked if I could come "speed up the internet" for them.
			</p>
			
			<p>So I drove out to their house with my laptop to take a look. The first thing I do is do a speed test. Just checking to see that they have a decent speed near the router.
			To my surprise it was incredibly low. When I asked how many different devices are connected to the Wi-Fi right now they simply shrugged. So I ran a "net view" command in the 
			command prompt to check. To my surprise there were 16 devices connected to the network.
			</p>
		            
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post_4.jpg" alt="">
          
			<p>So I removed unneccesary devices and did a speed check again. The speed was better, but not perfect. Just to be sure everything was cleared off of the router, I rebooted it 
			and checked the speed one last time. It seemed to be about normal now, maybe a little slower than perfect, but there were still a few devices connected. Lastly, I checked the speed in 
			the bedroom and noticed there was a weak connection.
			</p>
			
			<p>I suggested either moving the router to a closer location, or investing in a Mesh Wi-Fi which would distribute availability better than their existing set-up. Not only did my 
			family member decide to invest in a Mesh Wi-Fi system, they also boosted the speed coming into their house to 500 mb/s which made a dramatic difference.
