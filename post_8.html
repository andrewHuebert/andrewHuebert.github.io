			<p>I recently troublshot a familiy members Wi-Fi and discussed with them either upgrading their internet speed or switching to a mesh network. They ultimately decided on
			 both and chose a Google Wi-Fi mesh network. When they received it they asked if I could come help them set it up. And by help they meant completely set it up.
			</p>
			
			<p>Luckily for me the Google system is relatively simple to set up and install. To begin we simply had to unplug the power for the router and plug the 'main node' into the 
			ethernet port on the router. We then plugged the router back in and let that boot up with the main node. I had them sign in on their phone with Google and connected the main node 
			with a QR code on the bottom of the node.
			</p>
		            
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post_8.png" alt="">
          
			<p>We labeled where the main node was located and began adding other nodes around the house. We made sure to put one in their bedroom, where she was having trouble connecting. 
			We simply had to plug a node into the wall and label where it was in the App.
			</p>
			
			<p>When we finally added all the nodes I checked internet speed around the house and it was greatly improved. They now had great speed in their room, in the kitchen/living room 
			area and the garage, where the dad usually spends time. The mesh network coupled with the faster speed into the house made a huge difference for that familiy of 7.
