			<p>I recently, with my father, began upgrading and installing IoT devices in my home. I got him a Google home for Christmas and it just exploded from there.
			The most recent addition to our cluster of devices are light switches, with a "notification LED" and dimmers. The LED is what intriguied us the most.
			</p>
			
			<p>Physically installing them was not a difficult at all. It was as easy as removing the old light switch and wiring in the new ones and screwing it back into place. 
			The fun began when we connected it to Samsung's SmartThings. SmartThings is pretty intelligent and was able to scan and find the switches. We then labeled where we put the 
			switches and gave them all names.
			</p>
		            
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post_5.png" alt="">
          
			<p>Once the lights were named they could be configured to do turn on or off, dim up or down, or you could set "Scenes" that would be a specific preset. And these could tie 
			into the colored LED's that were in the kitchen and behind the TV. So we set a "Dad Morning" Scene that turned on the light above the sink, which lights the coffee maker, and 
			turns on the dining room lights, where he works when he is home. We set up a few other scenes like "Making Dinner" and "Watching a Movie" and then we moved on to the notification LED.
			</p>
			
			<p>The LED has the ability to recieve information from other IoT devices. So we set the switches in the bedrooms to have a Green light when the Garage State was "Open" and a 
			Red light when the Garage state was "Closed." We set all of the switches to Flash with a Purple light when the front door opened and a Yellow light when the back door opens. 
			We ran into trouble getting the LED's to return to the Green or Red state after they flashed a specific color, but noticed that the "process" which instructs the lights just 
			quits after the flash happens. So we added a rule to "Return to Previous State" at the end of every process and it fixed that problem.
