			<p>I've upated a few Palo Alto firewalls due to my internship doing Network Security, but doing one from home, due to the Stay-At Home Order made things interesting. Logging 
			into the firewall remotely and updating it was no problem. I simply had to VPN into the network and then access it through the Web GUI just as I would if I was On-Prem. But 
			to reset, after the update is completed, you usually have to be On-Prem to plug directly into the device and manually start up the services.
			</p>
			
			<p>This obviously presents a problem with not being able to be on site. However, there were a few employees going into the office occasionally. One of the accountants was 
			going in and stated they could help out.
			</p>
		            
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post_6.jpg" alt="">
          
			<p>So we had one of the accountants get one of the company laptops and set it up in the server room. He connected it to power and plugged it in to the firewall box. He set it up 
			so that it wouldn't go to sleep and just left it. We then simply Remote Desktop connected to that laptop.
			</p>
			
			<p>Once we were connected to the laptop it was as if we were in the room doing it as usual. We were able to start up the services and access the box from the Web-GUI like usual. We 
			terminated the connection and the job was complete!
