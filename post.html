          <p> Setting up a blog took more time than I expected. I began setting up a Jekyll blog using Bundle and Git Bash, but I was having issues intializing the site to begin with. There seemed to be an issue with the Jekyll gem itself. Everytime I tried to load it, I would get an error message
            stating that I hadn't fully loaded the proper kernel. </p>
          
          <p>After toying with the Jekyllk gem for long enough, I decided that it might just be easier to code my own blog site using a bootstrap template and theme. I still had to set up a new repository for the blog site, but instead of initializing a Jekyll site, you simply add the base code from the bootstrap template.
            This includes an index page, some sample text and a few images, along with the CSS and JS that is required to make the page function well. </p>
          
          <p>Once the base code has been added to the repo, I was able to make changes and create a blog post of my own. All I had to do was find the sample post file and enter my own information and styling.
            I changed the pictures that were included in the sample post and removed some links that seemed unneccesary. </p>
          
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="">
          
          <p>One problem that I ran into while creating this blog, was the issue with reloading pages after a file has been altered. When I make my changes and commit them to the Github repo, the page does not refresh to show the changes made.
          I have to recommit one of the JS files, with no change to the actual code, and then the page will show the changes made. While this is annoying, it is not that bad of an issue.</p>

          <p>All in all, this blog has been a hassle to set-up from the get go. I had quite an easy time with Jekyll last semester, but the new update made the whole process much more complicated. Thank goodness for alternatives.
          This blog, being hardcoded in HTML, is much easier to manage and less buggy than a full system like the Bundle and Jekyll blog.</p>
